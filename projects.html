                        <p>During the <a href="http://hack4reno.com/">2013 Hack4Reno</a> hack-a-thon I joined a team as iOS developer to take the existing Cycle Tracks iOS app and modify it to work for Reno Nevada. Cycle Tracks being an open source project I forked the GitHub repo and began work implementing it for Reno and more importantly updating the base code for iOS7, as iOS7 had a strong adoption rate I felt it would be crucial to support it. During the process I gained a love for finding bugs and more so for fixing them. I also did all the graphics/branding for app and most the graphics on the webpage.</p>
                        <p>After placing 2nd in the 24 hour coding event, we got support from a local biking advocacy group to help pay for the server hosting costs that were needed to bring the app to the app store. I continued to clean up the code and graphics for the application while soliciting beta testers for the app. I used testflight to manage the beta testing and once the all the known bugs were worked out I successfully submitted it to the app store.  
                            Our, Nevada Bicycling Coalition, efforts to bring the app and ideal of improved cycling infrastructure have proven success and still continue to this day.</p>

                        <p>As a volunteer webmaster I have been able to bring the local chapter of The Association of Accountants and Financial Professionals in Business (IMA) up-to-date and in compliance with organizational standards. Using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> framework and custom media queries I designed the chapters site to be fully responsive adapting and repositioning content for best fit on the displayed screen. I also used the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> library to add some interactions as well as the mobile menu bar page-slide effect. Additionally, I used jQuery to dynamically load page contents in an effort to reduce bandwidth and decrease page load time. The board of directors has been very appreciative of my volunteer service as they have taken it upon themselves enter the website into the organizations recognition of web presence competition. </p>
                        <p>Designing and coding this website I learned how to better adapt content for different screen sizes, as well as when to use a content management system (CMS). With this site I implemented a secondary site for testing built on Drupal. And while Drupal has all the tools and utilities needed to manage large sites, the IMA board had not wanted the features it could offer. Being financial professionals they didn't want the ability to post there own blog or event as they didn't not have the need or desire to do so. So with this site I ended the Drupal implementation as I felt I would learn more hand coding each element.</p>

                        <p>This project came from a need at my full time job. Currently many mining companies use a custom coordinate system (mine grid) for the mine site, making conversion of well hole, drill holes, or any pertinent point impossible by most handheld GPS units. I took it upon myself to create a web-based tool that can convert the common coordinate systems from and to the custom mine grid.</p>
                        <p>This tool is created in a few hours with jQuery and Bootstrap to adapt to any screen size. Plans to improve the site are underway and consist of more custom mine grids, allowing for offline use and making the site dedicated mobile app. I also have plans to improve the overall UI and further validation content.</p>

                        <p>Codetastic is a self named project in which you can write code and see the live results on the page. The site using a JavaScript library called CodeMirror to achieve its results, and currently supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As this is a personal project and is driven solely by my availability, it has been a work in progress and has many goals to further improve it. One of those goals was to make the app into a Windows 8 metro app which can currently be downloaded for free form the Windows app store. While the app is somewhat simple I have learned many new Windows technologies and have an improved version nearly ready for submission, implementing live view, using more metro charms, and saving user settings locally.</p>
